# Symfony Profiler Chrome extension

This Chrome exstension provides quick and easy access to the Symofony Profiler page for the
requested URL. If the user visits a page that has profiler information available, the user
can access the profiler page by clicking the extension icon next to the address bar. This is
particularly handy when debugging API calls, where the Symfony Toolbar is not visible.
